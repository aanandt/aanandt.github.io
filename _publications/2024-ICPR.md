excerpt: 'Breast ultrasound (BUS) imaging techniques have become efficient tools for cancer diagnosis. Convolutional neural network (CNN) based encoder-decoder architectures have been widely used for the automated segmentation of tumours in BUS images, assisting in breast cancer diagnoses. However, these models have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies. To overcome this limitation, various deep learning techniques, such as atrous convolution, attention mechanisms, and transformer encoder-based models, have been introduced to capture long-range dependencies in feature maps, improving segmentation accuracy by considering larger receptive fields and global context. As modelling techniques evolve, there is a shift towards more complex and intricate designs. This study proposes a simple yet effective model that combines UNet and Global Convolutional Network (GCN) architectures for breast lesion segmentation. By leveraging the GCN block, our model captures broader receptive fields with a simpler design strategy. We have demonstrated the efficacy of our approach through various experiments, including kernel size analysis, model component evaluation, and data preprocessing assessment. The proposed model has been evaluated using four-fold cross-validation with BUSI and Dataset-B datasets. Additionally, models trained on both datasets have been validated with a blind test dataset, where our model demonstrates better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 4.9% and 6.7% improvement in Intersection over Union (IoU) score, respectively. The robustness analysis and external validation experiments underscore the superior generalization performance of our model in breast lesion segmentation tasks.'
