excerpt: 'Music possesses the capacity to affect the human brain deeply, weaving together elements like melody, rhythm, timbre, lyrics, and pitch to elicit a wide range of emotional and cognitive responses. This study delves into the impact of Dhrupad, a genre within Indian classical music known for its meditative qualities, on the EEG responses. The EEG data were collected while participants immersed themselves in serene melodies of a Dhrupad alƒÅp performance on the Rudra Veena - a choice made for its gradual and soothing nature. Using 128-channel EEG, the signals from different brain regions are analysed. Multitaper spectrograms are employed to analyse the evolution of mental states. The proposed research reveals consistent patterns in the EEG signals for different levels of attentiveness. Especially, patterns correlate across different attentive subjects and suggest that the responses may be related to cognition.'
