excerpt: 'Automatic detection of seizures from EEG signals is an important problem of interest for clinical institutions. EEG is a temporal signal collected from multiple spatial sources around the scalp. Efficient modeling of both temporal and spatial information is important to identify the seizures using EEG. In this paper, we propose a neural network system using the time-delay neural network to model temporal information (TDNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) layer to model spatial information. On the development subset of Temple University seizure dataset, the proposed system achieved a sensitivity of 23.32 % with 11.13 false alarms in 24 hours.
